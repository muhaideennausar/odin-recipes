    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an authentic Indian naan recipe that's broiled instead of pan-fried. I have made it many times. It goes well with Indian curry dishes that have a lot of gravy, such as butter chicken.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Activate Yeast: Combine warm water, yeast, and sugar in a bowl. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.</li>
        <li>Make Dough: In a large bowl, mix flour, salt, yogurt, and activated yeast mixture. Knead until smooth and elastic (about 10 minutes).</li>
        <li>Flavor & Rest: Add ghee and kalonji seeds to the dough and knead for another minute. Cover the dough and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk warm water with yeast and sugar until yeast is dissolved. Cover and let stand in a warm place for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sift flour and salt three times into a large bowl. Add yeast mixture, yogurt, and 1/2 of the ghee. Mix into a soft dough, then knead on a floured surface until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place dough into a large greased bowl, cover, and let stand in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in volume.</li>
        <li>Punch down dough, then knead for 5 minutes. Divide dough into six equal pieces. Roll each piece out into 8-inch rounds.</li>
        <li>Cover an oven tray with foil and grease the foil. Brush dough rounds with remaining ghee and sprinkle with kalonji. Cook one at a time under the broiler until puffed and lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
    </ol>
