# Basic Recipe Website

This project implements a basic recipe website using HTML, following the guidelines set forth in [The Odin Project's Full Stack Web Development Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths).

This website serves as a foundation for building web pages with HTML. It focuses on structuring content using HTML elements and formatting the layout for a simple recipe.

## Technologies Used
